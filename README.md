# osu-cs261-assignment6
This project was created by Aline Murillo during the Winter 2023 Term for Oregon State University's Data Structures course.

## ðŸ”— Part 1 - Hash Map Implementation - Chaining
1. Implement the HashMap class by completing the following methods: put(), get(), remove(), contains_key(), clear(), empty_buckets(), resize_table(), table_load(), get_keys(), and find_mode().
2. Use a dynamic array to store the hash table and implement chaining for collision resolution using a singly linked list. Chains of key/value pairs must be stored in linked list nodes. The diagram below illustrates the overall architecture of the HashMap class.

3. Two pre-written classes are provided in the skeleton code - Dynamic Array and LinkedList (in a6_include.py). 
4. The number of objects stored in the hash map will be between 0 and 1,000,000 inclusive.
5. RESTRICTIONS: Not allowed to use ANY built-in Python data structures and/or methods. Not allowed to directly access any variables of the DynamicArray or LinkedList classes. All work is done using class methods. Not allowed to use any imports beyond the ones included in the source code.

## ðŸ“« Part 2 - Hash Map Implementation - Open Addressing
1. Implement the HashMap class by completing the following methods: put(), get(), remove(), contains_key(), clear(), empty_buckets(), resize_table(), table_load(), get_keys(), __iter__(), and __next__().
2. Use a dynamic array to store your hash table, and implement Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing for collision resolution inside that dynamic array.
3. Use the pre-written DynamicArray class in a6_include.py.
4. The number of objects stored in the hash map will be between 0 and 1,000,000 inclusive.
